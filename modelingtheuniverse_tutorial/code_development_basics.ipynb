    "  (use \"git restore --staged <file>...\" to unstage)\n",
    "\tnew file:   dummy.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "So we are tracking the changes to that file because we have added it! Let's `git commit` the changes/creation of that file so it will appear in our git history. Our git history is essentially a tracker of all the tiny changes we make to files in a repo. Imagine it like \"saving\"/version history of a word document. \n",

    "#### 3. Working with Git Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "Branches in Git let you **work on new features, bug fixes, or problem set solutions** without interfering with the `main` branch. Think of them as \"parallel copies\" of your repo where you can make changes safely without necessarily saving them to a \"final\" version of your repo.\n",

    "  remotes/origin/main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `*` indicates the branch you're currently on (here, `main`). As you can see that is our only branch and it tracks/pushes to `remotes/origin/main`, the github.com/remote version of your main branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a new branch:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "foo@bar:modelingtheuniverse_tutorial$ git checkout -b question1\n",
    "Switched to a new branch 'question1'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the `question1` branch does not exist yet, when we `git checkout` this branch we will both create it and switch to it.\n",

    "foo@bar:modelingtheuniverse_tutorial$ git branch\n",
    "  main\n",
    "* question1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now make changes in this branch and save them, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "foo@bar:modelingtheuniverse_tutorial$ echo \"print('Hello from Problem Set 1')\" > pset1.py\n",
    "foo@bar:modelingtheuniverse_tutorial$ git add pset1.py\n",
    "foo@bar:modelingtheuniverse_tutorial$ git commit -m \"Add pset1.py\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And push those changes to the remote version of this branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "foo@bar:modelingtheuniverse_tutorial$ git push -u origin question1\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `-u` sets this branch to track the remote one, so in the future you can just `git push`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are happy with the changes in this branch and want to them in our `main` branch you can open a pull request in github.com.\n",

    "### Code Development Best Practices + Environment Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "Now an important part of developing code for scientific projects (especially in collaborative settings and for the sake of reproducibility) is the follow some best practices of environment management on top of the github workflow for version tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Staying organized with environments is important because different projects/problem sets might need different packages/libraries or even different versions of said packages/libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid conflicts, it is a good practice to use a `per-repo isolated environment` instead of installing several packages globally on your computer. **[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is a very helpful and powerful tool for this.**\n",
    "\n",
    "[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is a fast and efficient Python package and environment manager. It creates lightweight virtual environments, installs dependencies and keeps them reproducible, and keeps environments clean on a `per-repo` basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up a Project/Repo Environment with `uv`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Create an environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside your repo/problem set directory, let's create a virtual environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "foo@bar:modelingtheuniverse_tutorial$ uv venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a `.venv/` folder inside your repo. This is a hidden folder that contains its own Python and common Python libraries/packages + additional ones you add.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can activate this virtual environment like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "foo@bar:modelingtheuniverse_tutorial$ source .venv/bin/activate\n",
    "(modelingtheuniverse_tutorial) foo@bar:modelingtheuniverse_tutorial$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Installing packages\n",
    "You can now add packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "(modelingtheuniverse_tutorial) foo@bar:modelingtheuniverse_tutorial$ uv pip install astropy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can save all the installed packages so collaborators can reproduce your code by doing the following which will create a `requirements.txt` file with the packages listed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "(modelingtheuniverse_tutorial) foo@bar:modelingtheuniverse_tutorial$ uv pip freeze > requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, you can transfer this `requirements.txt` file to other repos and install it in other `uv` virtual environments by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "(another_venv) foo@bar:[another_repo]$ uv pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Best Practies\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always activate your environment before running code or Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep a requirements.txt in every repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you break your environment, you can safely delete .venv/ and recreate it with `uv venv` + `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`."

    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are very useful tools. They are essentially interactive documents where you can code and add markdown (text explanations). This is a Jupyter notebook!\n",

    "\n",
    "To do this, install VS Code and in the extensions tab download the Python extension and the Jupyter extension. This will allow you to edit interactive `.ipynb` notebooks and you can easily select your environments (like `.venv`) as the **kernel**. Kernels are the engines that run your code. Kernels are tied to specific environments like the one we created. You can follow this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FZzw9nF8Rg) that goes through the steps of downloading the Jupyter extension in VS Code."
